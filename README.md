## Projects (Python)

Here are some projects I've worked on:

**1. Exploring the Milky Way with a Radio Telescope**
- Utilised a radio telescope to observe neutral hydrogen clouds in the Milky Way's plane.
- Analysed and visualised observational data using Python.
- Results: Estimated the mass of the Milky Way, confirmed the existence of dark matter, and validated the spiral structure of our galaxy.

**2. Compton Scattering Experiment - Quantum Mechanics Investigation**
- Conducted a live experiment remotely using lab apparatus at the OU campus.
- Investigated Compton scattering, the interaction of X-ray photons with electrons.
- Recreated a Nobel Prize-winning experiment, confirming a fundamental result in quantum mechanics: the momentum carried by photons.

**3. Space Mission to Mars - Infrared Spectroscopy Analysis**
- Collected infrared spectra data of known and unknown gas samples.
- Utilised a replica of a Mars mission instrument for authenticity.
- Identified gases and matched unknown samples to specific planetary atmospheres.

**4. Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Product Reviews**
- Conducted sentiment analysis on a dataset of Amazon product reviews using spaCy and SpacyTextBlob for natural language processing.
- Explored sentiment trends, providing insights into customer opinions on various products.
- Developed a Python script for sentiment analysis, producing a PDF report on findings.

**5. University Induction Chatbot**
- Designed and implemented a chatbot to assist in the induction of first-year university students.
- Interacts with users, answering questions and providing information.
- Aims to enhance the onboarding experience for new students.

**6. Radiation Levels Calculator**
- Developed a program for calculating average and standard deviation of radiation levels recorded in various locations.
- Includes an option to add data for new locations, providing a comprehensive overview of radiation exposure.
- Designed to assist in monitoring and managing radiation levels in different environments.
